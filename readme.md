This add-on allows to listen the typed symbols (non alphanumeric characters), even when the speaking of typed characters is turned off in NVDA.

It's based on the old ReportSymbols add-on, developed by the same author. You should uninstall it to use this version.

Note: A gesture to open this dialog can be assigned from NVDA menu, Preferences submenu, Input gestures dialog, Configuration category.
